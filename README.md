# Hangman

## About
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)) :
> Hangman is a guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.

# Main Feature

## Option to save a game & load it later

Typing `:w` at any point, starting from when the guessing starts, will save a copy of the game to a `yaml` file. The next time you play the game, it'll prompt you to choose whether to load a saved game or start a new one.

This was the main concept I practiced with this project.
